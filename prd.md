## 7. Risks and Mitigations

### 7.1 Technical Risks
- **Risk**: CORS issues between frontend and API
  - **Mitigation**: Use AppSync GraphQL API with appropriate configuration

- **Risk**: Authentication complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Leverage Cognito for standard auth patterns

- **Risk**: Data consistency for swap operations
  - **Mitigation**: Implement transaction guarantees in DynamoDB

### 7.2 User Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: User difficulty with swap system
  - **Mitigation**: Intuitive UI and clear instructions

- **Risk**: Resistance to score entry
  - **Mitigation**: Make score entry simple and gamified

## 8. Success Metrics
